This is a growing collection of updated commands I've built up over the recent
years.

************


* REFERENCES *

\referToSection{<label>}

Refer to labels section:<label>.


\referToFigure{<label>}

Refer to labels figure:<label>.


\referToTable{<label>}

* FIGURES *

\includeFigure[<options>]{<filename>}{<caption>}[<float>]

This command allows you to quickly import a figre using the regular
\includegraphics command from graphicx. The figure is pulled from the
``figures'' directory which is assumed to exist in the project root.

Arguments: 

<options> You have a choice here, either specify a numeric value which will
default to the scale of the included graphic, or the entire options string for
\includegraphics, e.g. "width=\textwidth". Defaults to 1.

<filename> The graphic filename with/without extension. The figure's label is
thereafter deterministically set to "figure:filename".

<caption> The caption for the image. Commands are allowed in the caption.

<float> This argument to allows you to change the floating options of the figure.
Defaults to htbp!.


* SECTIONS *

\startSection[<level>]{<name>}[<label>]

A shorthand for defining sections, subsection and so on which also defines a
label for the section.

Arguments:

<level> Level of the section to define, for now only 1, 2 & 3 are supported.

<name> Name of the section. If the name matches [a-z_-' ]/i, the label becomes
the name lower-cased with space characters replaced by dashes. This allows to
quickly reference a section, subsection etc. using the
\referToSection{preparsed-name}.

<label> Override label to allow commands and other special characters in the
name. The final label is always prefixed with section: regardleth of the depth.
