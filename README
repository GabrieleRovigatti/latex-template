This is a growing collection of updated commands I've built up over the recent
years.

* COMMANDS *
************


* REFERENCES *

The way references are styled is inspired by Accelerated C++, ISBN
0-201-70353-X. The idea is to both show the section/figure/table counter value
AND the page where to find the section/figure/table. This allows for the reader
to easier lookup the reference since the reader only has to look up the page
and then the section on the page rather then lookup the section through the
entire opus with only a rough idea of where to find the section/figure/table.

\referToSection{<label>}

Refer to labels section:<label>.


\referToFigure{<label>}

Refer to labels figure:<label>.


\referToTable{<label>}

Refer to labels tabel:<label>.


* FIGURES *

\includeFigure[<options>]{<filename>}{<caption>}[<float>]

This command allows you to quickly import a figre using the regular
\includegraphics command from graphicx. The figure is pulled from the
``figures'' directory which is assumed to exist in the project root.

Arguments: 

<options> You have a choice here, either specify a numeric value which will
default to the scale of the included graphic, or the entire options string for
\includegraphics, e.g. "width=\textwidth". Defaults to 1.

<filename> The graphic filename with/without extension. The figure's label is
thereafter deterministically set to "figure:filename".

<caption> The caption for the image. Commands are allowed in the caption.

<float> This argument to allows you to change the floating options of the figure.
Defaults to htbp!.


* SECTIONS *

\startSection[<level>]{<name>}[<label>]

A shorthand for defining sections, subsections and so on. The command attempts
to generate a label for the section, sparing you the expense.

Arguments:

<level> Level of the section to define, for now only 1, 2 & 3 are supported.
See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure#Sectioning_Commands
for more information. Defaults to 1.

<name> Name of the section. If the name matches [a-z_-' ]/i, the label becomes
the name lower-cased with space characters replaced by dashes. This allows to
quickly reference a section, subsection, and so on, using the
\referToSection{<label>} command. ATTENTION! If the name contains characters
other than those that are allowed, and and no label override is provided, no
warning or error is produced, so the script may fail if the \label command
refuses the input. 

<label> Override label to allow commands and other special characters in the
name. The final label is always prefixed with section: regardleth of the depth.
Defaults to : see <name> argument.
