This is a growing collection of updated commands I've built up over the recent
years.

*********
* SETUP *
*********

Setup is the part of the package where a series of commands have been supplied
to enable initial document setup, such as the title, due date, headers and
footers, etc.

There's not too much freedom due to a farely constrained initial layout, and
besides, the package is meant for university assignments which should bear a
resemblance to one another in terms of layout.

The macros also make sure to both update the latex \title and \author, as well
as the pdftitle and pdfauthor specifications in \hypersetup.

To start of with, there are two options, you can choose to apply the fancy
style included in the package or not, by either specifying
\usepackage[fancy]{oleks} or \usepacakge{oleks} respectively.

\setup{<keyvalues>}

General properties setup, except for the author.

<keyvalues>

[location] This is the university or other type of ``location''.

[subject] This is the subject for which this assignment is written.

[assignment] This is the name of the assignment; effectively becomes the
title of the document.

[date] The default functionality of the day's date being specified given \date
is not very useful. Usually, what you want to specify is the assignment due
date. The [date] specfier allows you to do just that. The default \date
functionality is also overriden so you don't make such a silly mistake.

\setup[<keyvalues>]{<author>}

<author> Is the long author specification which will show up with the document
title. It is also the default value for a short author specification, see
furhter under Keyvalues.

<keyvalues>

[short] This is the short author specification, overriding this value allows
you to specify a shorter author specification for the top left corner header,
in case the long author specification does not fit.

[addendum] More often then not an addendum is required for to the names of the
students involved like some sort of identification number. This specification
will show up in the top left corner of the header, just below the short/long
author specification.


************
* COMMANDS *
************


* REFERENCES *

The way references are styled is inspired by Accelerated C++, ISBN
0-201-70353-X. The idea is to both show the section/figure/table counter value
AND the page where to find the section/figure/table. This allows for the reader
to easier lookup the reference since the reader only has to look up the page
and then the section on the page rather then lookup the section through the
entire opus with only a rough idea of where to find the section/figure/table.

\referToSection{<label>}

Refer to labels section:<label>.


\referToFigure{<label>}

Refer to labels figure:<label>.


\referToTable{<label>}

Refer to labels tabel:<label>.


* FIGURES *

\includeFigure[<options>]{<filename>}{<caption>}[<float>]

This command allows you to quickly import a figre using the regular
\includegraphics command from graphicx. The figure is pulled from the
``figures'' directory which is assumed to exist in the project root.

Arguments: 

<options> You have a choice here, either specify a numeric value which will
default to the scale of the included graphic, or the entire options string for
\includegraphics, e.g. "width=\textwidth". Defaults to 1.

<filename> The graphic filename with/without extension. The figure's label is
thereafter deterministically set to "figure:filename".

<caption> The caption for the image. Commands are allowed in the caption.

<float> This argument to allows you to change the floating options of the figure.
Defaults to htbp!.


* SECTIONS *

\startSection[<level>]{<name>}[<label>]

A shorthand for defining sections, subsections and so on. The command attempts
to generate a label for the section, sparing you the expense.

Arguments:

<level> Level of the section to define, for now only 1, 2 & 3 are supported.
See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure#Sectioning_Commands
for more information. Defaults to 1.

<name> Name of the section. If the name matches [a-z_-' ]/i, the label becomes
the name lower-cased with space characters replaced by dashes. This allows to
quickly reference a section, subsection, and so on, using the
\referToSection{<label>} command. ATTENTION! If the name contains characters
other than those that are allowed, and and no label override is provided, no
warning or error is produced, so the script may fail if the \label command
refuses the input. 

<label> Override label to allow commands and other special characters in the
name. The final label is always prefixed with section: regardleth of the depth.
Defaults to : see <name> argument.

* TABLES *

\makeTable[<float>]{<label>}{<caption>}{<layout>}{<headers>}{<rows>}

A shortcut to making tables.

Arguments:

<float> The float specification for the surrounding table environment. Defaults
to htbp!.

<label> The label for the table, however the final label is prefixed by table:.

<caption> The caption for the table. The caption may contain commands.

<layout> The usual layout specification for the columns, e.g. |c|c|c|.

<headers> The headers of the table. By default the header row is separated with
a hard line. It is common for the headers to be bold, however there doesn't
seem to be a simple way to do this, yet. The columns should be separated by &,
as usual.

<rows> The rows of the table separated by \\ with the columns separated by &,
as usual.
