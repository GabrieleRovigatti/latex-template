This is a growing collection of updated commands I've built up over the recent
years.

\image[][]{}{}

This command allows you to quickly import an image as a figure using the
regular \includegraphics command from graphicx.

1. You have a choice here, either specify a numeric value which will default to
the scale of the included graphic, or the entire options string for
\includegraphics, e.g. "width=\textwidth". Defaults to 1.

2. This argument to allows you to change the floating options of the figure.
Defaults to htbp!.

3. The graphic filename with/without extension. The image has to be located in
an images folder relative to the file from where the command is called. The
figure's label is thereafter deterministically set to "image:filename".

4. The caption for the image. Commands are allowed in the caption.
